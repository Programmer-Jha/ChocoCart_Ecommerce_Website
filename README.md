# ChocoCart_Ecommerce_Website
ChocoCart is a simple yet complete e-commerce website designed for selling chocolates online. I built it using PHP for the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap(Framework) for the frontend. The goal was to create a smooth and enjoyable shopping experience for chocolate lovers. I had also used PHPMailer, for OTP.
