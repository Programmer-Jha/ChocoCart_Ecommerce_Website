## Important Note on PHPMailer Credentials

The project includes PHPMailer for email-related functionalities such as OTP verification and sending invoices.  
**For security reasons, all email credentials (email ID and password) have been removed from the project files.**

### To enable email functionality, you must:  
1. Open the PHP file(s) where PHPMailer is configured (e.g., `client/checkout.php` or relevant backend files).  
2. Replace the placeholder Senders Email Address and Emails App Password with your own valid email credentials.  
3. Ensure your email provider allows SMTP access and “less secure app” access if needed.
